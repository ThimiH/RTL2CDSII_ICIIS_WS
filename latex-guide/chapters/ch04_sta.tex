\chapter{Static Timing Analysis (STA)}
\label{ch:sta}

This chapter references the Week 7 tutorial for STA. Steps here should show how to prepare timing libraries, constraints (SDC), run STA and interpret reports.

\section{Installation}
Tools: OpenSTA (open-source), or commercial PrimeTime. Provide install or obtain instructions.

\section{Steps}
1. Create SDC constraints (clock definitions, input/output delays, false paths).
2. Run STA and capture worst negative slack (WNS), total negative slack (TNS), and report per path.
3. Interpret and iterate (e.g., fix paths by buffer insertion or constraint adjustments).

\section{Expected outputs}
- STA reports and annotated netlists.
