\chapter{Netlist generation}
\label{ch:netlist}

This chapter follows the Week 5 NPTEL tutorial on netlist generation. Document the flow used to generate gate-level netlists from RTL using open-source or commercial tools.

\section{Installation}
Tools: Yosys (open-source synthesis) or commercial synthesis (Synopsys Design Compiler). Provide install instructions and necessary libraries.

\section{Steps}
1. Run synthesis (Yosys script example placeholder).
2. Produce gate-level netlist (Verilog or BLIF).
3. Run basic linting and consistency checks.

\section{Notes}
Refer to Week 5 tutorial for recommended synthesis options and constraints.
