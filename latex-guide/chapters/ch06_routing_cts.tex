\chapter{Routing and Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)}
\label{ch:routing}

Based on Week 12 tutorial: routing, clock-tree synthesis and timing closure steps.

\section{Installation}
Tools: OpenROAD (route and CTS) or commercial tools. Provide install notes and any required tech files.

\section{Steps}
1. Run CTS (specify clock nets and constraints).
2. Perform global and detailed routing.
3. Extract parasitics and re-run STA for sign-off.

\section{Final product: IO package view}
Show how to export final layout snapshots and present them in an IO-package figure. If open tools cannot generate the exact IO-package representation requested, document the Synopsys steps under the Appendix.
