\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope and Objectives}
This guidebook documents the step-by-step flow used in the ICIIS workshop: starting from RTL (Verilog), performing synthesis and netlist generation, Static Timing Analysis (STA), placement and power planning, and finishing with routing and Clock-Tree Synthesis (CTS).

The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive workflow for converting a Register Transfer Level design into a GDSII layout using specific demonstration designs.

\section{How to Use This Guide}
Each chapter contains an ``Installation'' subsection with required tools and environment setup, followed by step-by-step instructions and expected outputs.

\section{Installation Overview}
To follow this workshop, the following general prerequisites are required:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General Tools:} TeX live (for documentation), git.
    \item \textbf{Open-Source EDA Tools:} Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, OpenSTA, OpenROAD, OpenLane.
    \item \textbf{Commercial Tools (Optional/Reference):} Synopsys Design Compiler, PrimeTime, and IC Compiler II (used for comparison or specific visualizations like the IO package view if open tools are insufficient).
\end{itemize}

Detailed installation instructions for specific tools are provided at the beginning of their respective chapters.

\section{Workshop File Layout}
The PDF version of this guide is meant to live in the same directory as the provided \texttt{RTL2GDS\_WS\_Files/} folder. The bundle already contains the scripts and RTL referenced throughout the chapters:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]

\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The technology libraries are now shipped with the workshop files. Inside \texttt{RTL2GDS\_WS\_Files/lib/} you will find the SkyWater SKY130 HD assets referenced throughout this guide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{sky130\_fd\_sc\_hd\_\_tt\_025C\_1v80.lib} (Liberty timing/power)
    \item \texttt{sky130\_v5\_5.lef} and \texttt{output.lef} (technology + standard cell LEFs)
    \item \texttt{sky130\_fd\_sc\_hd.tf} plus auxiliary files such as \texttt{sky130\_fd\_sc\_hd\_\_tt\_025C\_1v80.db}
\end{itemize}
