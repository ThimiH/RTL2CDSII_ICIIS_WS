\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope and Objectives}
This guidebook documents the step-by-step flow used in the ICIIS workshop: starting from RTL (Verilog), performing synthesis and netlist generation, Static Timing Analysis (STA), placement and power planning, and finishing with routing and Clock-Tree Synthesis (CTS)[cite: 10].

The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive workflow for converting a Register Transfer Level design into a GDSII layout using specific demonstration designs.

\section{How to Use This Guide}
Each chapter contains an ``Installation'' subsection with required tools and environment setup, followed by step-by-step instructions and expected outputs[cite: 14].

\section{Installation Overview}
To follow this workshop, the following general prerequisites are required:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General Tools:} TeX live (for documentation), git.
    \item \textbf{Open-Source EDA Tools:} Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, OpenSTA, OpenROAD, OpenLane[cite: 17, 91].
    \item \textbf{Commercial Tools (Optional/Reference):} Synopsys Design Compiler, PrimeTime, and IC Compiler II (used for comparison or specific visualizations like the IO package view if open tools are insufficient)[cite: 17, 86, 98].
\end{itemize}

Detailed installation instructions for specific tools are provided at the beginning of their respective chapters.
